Hi! :sparkler:

This is assignment 3 for JavaScript Framework course. 

I decided to make a dice roller and took inspiration from a specific mobile app design in dribble made by Zesan h. (https://dribbble.com/shots/17423785-Weather-Interface).

My initial idea was letting the user select what dice they wanted to roll but that project had to be put aside for now since it was gonna take longer than the assignment was made for. 

The colors for the app are chosen from a DnD guide and can be found here (https://www.redraggedfiend.com/introduction-hex-mapping/#mobile-header-left-nav), as well as your basic greyscale colors for text and so on.

Thank you for reading and good luck playing! :game-die:
